<h1> HML - Hardware Middle Layer </h1>

<h3> What is HML </h3>
<p>
HML is a lite and easy-use firmware library & BSP set for some MCUs and boards,such as 8051 and STC89 series MCUs now(refer to <a href="http://hw.zhishan-iot.ga/page/hml/index.html#support-list"> support-list </a> for details).It coded with C language and compiled by <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/"> SDCC </a> compiler.HML aimed to provide a bridge from originality to hardware,help people develop more quickly.Besides,we found there is lack of application examples about SDCC on the Internet,even if SDCC is free and high-efficiency.So we decide to code HML to exploit the field and share our experience.HML opens all source files on GitHub.Welcome advice from you!
